Self-learning on how to implement TDD in Swift. 
The sample application build is FizzBuzz by https://medium.com/@ynzc/getting-started-with-tdd-in-swift-2fab3e07204b#.uzor8pyx2


### For this self-learning, I used:

 - XCTestCase ( default iOS Test framework )
 - Quick Framework for BDD
 - Nimble Framework for TDD

I refactored the XCTestCase test to used the 2 framework that I mentioned. ( Not yet finish )
